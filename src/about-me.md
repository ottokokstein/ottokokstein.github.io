My name is Otto Kokstein, and I am a student in the Czech Republic with the goal of studying nuclear engineering in the future.

My areas of interest include programming, software developent, 3D modelling and 3D printing.

I started learning Python in 2022 and since then, I have also picked up some basic Java, TypeScript and Rust.

I am currently working as a freelance software developer.

I also have a Youtube channel where I post videos about my projects.
