[Enderal: Forgotten Stories](https://store.steampowered.com/app/933480/Enderal_Forgotten_Stories/) (formerly Enderal: Shards of Order) is a [Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/) modification often considered a stand-alone game due to its sheer quality and scale. Since 2020, I have been <span class="tooltip" title="localization = translation and adaptation of a game to a specific language so that the translation feels natural to players and aligns with local customs and culture (localization includes, for example, converting units like feet to meters, etc.)">localizing</span> (translating) it into Czech.

## Content

### What will be localized

Every single in-game text, for example:

- Names of items, spells, locations, quests and NPCs
- Dialogues (in the form of subtitles)
- Quest objectives and journal entries
- Most books
- Texts in textures
- Menus and settings
- Cinematics (in the form of subtitles)
- System messages

### What won't be localized

- Game launcher (localization not supported)
- Audio
- "The Butcher of Ark" book series

## Motivation

Ever since first playing Enderal and discovering that it was missing a Czech localization, I knew it was something I wanted to pursue. My main motivation was to allow Czech players to enjoy its lore, story and ambience without any language barriers.

## Process

Strings (in-game texts) are localized in [xTranslator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134) and textures are edited in [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com). Enderal's cinematics were localized by burning subtitles into them (I have posted a [guide](subtitles.md) detailing the exact process I used, if you are interested).

More info about the process of localization itself can be found [here](https://en.wiki.sureai.net/Enderal:Localization).

## Download

When the localization is finished, it will be available on Steam just as any other official localization. I will also post the files here on my website with a guide detailing the process of manually downloading them and implementing them into the game.
