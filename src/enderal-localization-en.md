[Enderal: Forgotten Stories](https://store.steampowered.com/app/933480/Enderal_Forgotten_Stories/) (formerly Enderal: Shards of Order) is a [Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/) modification often considered a stand-alone game due to its sheer quality and scale. Between 2020 and 2025, I localized[^1] Enderal into Czech, including both the original version and the fan-made port for Skyrim Special Edition.

## Content

### What is localized

Almost every in-game text, for example:

- Names of items, spells, locations, quests and NPCs
- Dialogues (in the form of subtitles)
- Quest objectives and journal entries
- Most books
- Texts in textures
- Menus and settings
- Cinematics (in the form of subtitles)
- System messages

### What isn't localized

- Game launcher
- Audio
- "The Butcher of Ark" book series

Note: If you choose to play as a female character, the game will still address you as male, as I have not yet found a way to provide separate strings for male and female protagonists.

## Motivation

Ever since first playing Enderal and discovering that it was missing a Czech localization, I knew it was something I wanted to pursue. My main motivation was to allow Czech players to enjoy its lore, story and ambience without any language barriers.

## Process

Strings (in-game texts) were localized in [xTranslator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134) and textures edited in [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com). Enderal's cinematics were localized by burning subtitles into them (I have posted a [guide](subtitles.md) detailing the exact process I used, if you are interested).

More info about the process of localization itself can be found [here](https://en.wiki.sureai.net/Enderal:Localization).

## Download

The localization can be downloaded on Nexus Mods, where I uploaded it with the developers’ permission. Nexus Mods is also ideal for reporting bugs and issues, so feel free to leave a message there if you encounter any problems.

<hr />

[^1]: localization = the translation and adaptation of a game into a given language so that the translation feels natural to players and aligns with local customs and culture. Localization therefore includes not only the translation itself but also, for example, converting units, using slang and colloquial language where appropriate, translating names of places and characters, and so on.
